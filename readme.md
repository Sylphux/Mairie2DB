# Scrapping day

## DarkTrader.rb
Today, I learned to make scrapping apps with ruby.
The first one, DarkTrader.rb scraps 'https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/' and returns the crypto names and their values at given time

## Mairie_Christmas.rb
The second one scans a townhalls list and goes on their specific page to retrieve their emails.
Then all is combined in a hash array.
You can search a custom link to retrieve town hall emails from specific regions.
